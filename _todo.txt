* Select photo
* Split up PhotoKaleidoscope - eg a RotationView and insides

* Live camera
* 3-d shapes

KAL-23-08: 2023/10/05 - Select a Photo
* Split out PhotoSelector and PhotoKaleidoscope from ContentView


KAL-23-07: 2023/10/4 - Tangled Up in Boundaries
* Image still cuts off around the edges sometimes
* Get rid of offsets (like "+ 5.0") in Angle+toXY - did this with negative padding - that fixed the edges being cut off
* Modify toXOffset and toYOffset to make sure they put pie inside the view; update tests
* Use PhotosPicker to let user find photo; we don't yet use it

KAL-23-06: 2023/10/03 - Respecting Boundaries
* Set up an Experiment tab
* Empirically reworked Angle+toXY() to keep pie in bounds
* Realized we're moving the picture AND the Tab View changes the picture size, pushing us out of bounds on the main view (even though the experiment was ok)
* Changed Experiment to move image underneath the pie

KAL-23-05: 2023/10/02 - Rotation or File Selection
* Rotate device - yaw sets the angle of rotation


KAL-23-04: 9/28/23 - Map Rotation to x/y
* Map rotation angle to a combination of x and y
* Adjust pie calculations to avoid affine transformations
* Adjusted top-level to tell number of mirrored segments rather than counting segment and its mirror separately
* Pull out angle methods from ContentView
* Test repeats on AngleToXY

KAL-23-03: 9/27/23 - Motion
* Move - add a drag gesture that relocates the point of interest
* Explored drag, rotate, and scale gestures
* Started mapping rotation to x/y

KAL-23-02: 9/26/23 - Mirroring
* Make kaleidoscope image - mirrored
* With a fixed image

KAL-23-01: 9/25/23 - Introducing Kaleid
* Get a pie-shaped piece of Color
* Clipped a photo to pie shape but didn't get the whole pie
